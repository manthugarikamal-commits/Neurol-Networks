## 📌 Overview

The project covers:
- Creating a neural network using `nn.Sequential`
- Defining input and output tensors
- Using **ReLU** activation
- Training the model using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** loss
- Optimizing with the **Adam optimizer**

This project is suitable for **beginners** who are learning neural networks and PyTorch.
